            <h4>Please self-isolate for 14 days. You do not need testing for COVID-19.</h4>

            <p>There are many common viruses other than COVID-19 that can cause your symptoms. Based on your responses you do not need to be tested for COVID-19 at this time. You should stay at home and not go to work or school until 24 hours after your symptoms have resolved, without the use of fever-reducing medication and avoid close contact with people in your home as well as people with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and older adults.</p>

            <p>If your symptoms become worse, call 811. 811 is currently experiencing heavy call volumes. You may be asked to leave a message. Weâ€™ll get back to you as ask quickly as possible.</p>
